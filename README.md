## Description 
This is my first neural network and likely the simplest one I'll build. No framework was used; everything was built 
from scratch using numpy. Basic batch gradient descent was employed to minimize the cost function. Due to the lack of structural complexity, traning examples, and tuning of hyperparameters, the network could only acheive an 
accuracy of 80% on the test set. Nontheless, it performed better than logistic regression as expected.
