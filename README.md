## Description 
This is my first neural network and probably the simplest one I'll ever build. No framework was used; everything was built 
from scratch using numpy. Basic batch gradient descent was employed to minimize the cost function. Due to the lack of structural complexity, traning examples, and tuning of hyperparameters, the network could only acheive an 
accuracy of 80% on the test set. Nontheless, it was a good introduction to deep learning for me.
